# pix2pixhd-medical

This repository contains research code for conditional mask-to-image medical image synthesis using pix2pixHD.

The framework is evaluated across two domains:
- LGG brain MRI tumour data
- ISIC skin lesion data

The code accompanies an arXiv research report and is provided for transparency and experimentation.

## Reproducibility note
Some preprocessing steps were simplified or omitted in the released code for clarity. These changes do not affect the qualitative conclusions reported in the paper.

## Data
Datasets are not included. Place datasets under `data/` following the expected structure.
